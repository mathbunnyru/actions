Reusable workflows and actions for XRPLF repos

## Available Actions

- `cleanup-workspace`: Cleans up the GitHub Actions workspace, should be used for self-hosted runners before running any steps.
- `create-issue`: Creates an issue in the repository with a specified title and body.
- `get-nproc`: Retrieves the number of processing units available on the runner.
- `prepare-runner`: Prepares the GitHub Actions runner environment for subsequent steps.
- `print-build-env`: Prints environment related to the build process.
- `release-info`: Derives the release channel (`stable`, `rc`, `beta`, `develop` or `private`) and the package release number for a build.

## Available Git Actions

- `clone-repo`: Clones a repository authenticated with a token, so that subsequent plain git commands work without additional setup.
- `configure-git`: Configures the git user identity (name and email) for the current job.
- `configure-github-app`: Creates a token for a GitHub App and exposes its git user identity, for use with `configure-git`.

## Available Reusable Workflows

- `build-multiarch-image.yml`: Builds a multi-architecture Docker image and pushes it to a container registry.
- `check-pr-commits.yml`: Checks the commits in Pull Requests are signed.
- `check-pr-title.yml`: Checks the title of Pull Requests against a specified pattern.
- `determine-tidy-files.yml`: Determines which files have been modified in a Pull Request and sets an output variables with the list of those files.
- `pre-commit.yml`: Runs `pre-commit` checks on code changes.
- `pre-commit-autoupdate.yml`: Runs `pre-commit autoupdate` to update pre-commit hooks.
- `sync-branches-tags.yml`: Synchronizes branches and tags between two repositories.

## Maintenance Tools

### update_hashes.py

A Python script to update hash references to XRPLF/actions in GitHub workflow/actions YAML files.

This script searches for references like:

- `XRPLF/actions/get-nproc@<hash>`
- `XRPLF/actions/.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml@<hash>`

Then updates them with the latest commit hash that modified the referenced directory.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Dry run (show what would be updated)
python3 update_hashes.py --dry-run /path/to/directory
```

**Arguments:**

- `--dry-run`: Show what would be updated without making changes (optional)
- Path to the git directory (positional argument)
