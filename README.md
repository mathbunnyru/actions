## Maintenance Tools

### update_hashes.py

A Python script to update hash references to XRPLF/actions in GitHub workflow/actions YAML files.

This script searches for references like:

- `XRPLF/actions/get-nproc@<hash>`
- `XRPLF/actions/.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml@<hash>`

Then updates them with the latest commit hash that modified the referenced directory.

**Usage:**

```bash
# Dry run (show what would be updated)
python3 update_hashes.py --dry-run /path/to/directory
```

**Arguments:**

- `--dry-run`: Show what would be updated without making changes (optional)
- Path to the git directory (positional argument)
